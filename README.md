# BDv2
Current repo for all my BDv2 content.
<br><br>
You can use and test themes by downloading the repo then placing each of the folders in your /betterdiscord/ext/theme folder.
<br>

It would be very helpful if people contributed even just by sending bug reports or whatever. 

You can open an issue, or send a PR to the repo. If you want to help more request access and let me know.
