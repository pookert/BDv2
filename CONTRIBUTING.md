If you would like to contribute to any of my content then please follow these basic guidelines. 
I will update and change these as I see fit. Be sure to review this often.



Check issues, PR's and the project board first. 
I will do most of my work here, and only small updates to the current v1 repos to fix changes in discord.


Steps/Guidlines: 
* Decide if you should create an issue or make a PR.
* If you make a PR, never send it to master. It will be instantly rejected.
* All work should be done on another branch.
* When you make a PR. It should follow my style and match the theme.
* Label and comment your issues/PR's. They should be as detailed as possible or needed. I shouldnt have to add stuff for you. 
* No unnecessary code/comments or extras in the css.
